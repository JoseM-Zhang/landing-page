            <p><em>So yeah, Kessoku Band’s self-titled debut is a great time. The vocals are excellent, the production is mostly solid, there’s a decent amount of variety, and the highlights are truly quite high. I really loved “Bocchi The Rock”, and I very much hope that future seasons of the anime also have accompanying albums. That would be amazing!</em></p>
